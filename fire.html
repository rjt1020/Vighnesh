<em style="color: black;font-size: 18px;font-weight: 600;">Automatic Fire Extinguishing Systems</em><br><br>
Fire Suppression Systems form the second line of defense in the fight to stop a fire. These products quickly put out the fire using various agents namely Carbon Dioxide (CO2), FM 200, MICKRO K, INERGEN, which remove fire sustaining agents (namely air, fuel or heat) in the area thereby stopping the fire. These agents are harmless to humans and are very effective in averting major disasters.

<b>Fire Hydrant and Sprinkler System</b><br><br>

Water and fire fighting will always be together. Globally, water is our most plentiful resource. It is inexpensive. When public water systems are present, it is available in an almost endless supply. When applied properly, it is very effective in absorbing heat and extinguishing fires. For these reasons, fire services throughout the world base their primary operations upon utilizing water as a fire extinguishing agent. Hydrant system is a mechanism where water is pumped, tapped off and released in the form of a jet through a nozzle to extinguish fire.<br>
Hydrant System can be implemented in two ways:<br><br>
<em style="color: black;font-size: 18px;font-weight: 600">Fire Escape Hydrant Systems</em><br><br>
It's a type of Hydrant system that is used extensively in high rise buildings where special outlets are provided on each floor.<br><br>
<em style="color: black;font-size: 18px;font-weight: 600">Yard Hydrant Systems</em><br><br>
Yard hydrant system is a method where fire hydrant network is led throughout the designated premises.
When Fire Sprinkler System is incorporated along with the Fire Hydrant System, within premises, it provides an effective measure against Fire.
A fire sprinkler system is an active fire protection measure, consisting of a water supply system, providing adequate pressure and flow rate to a water distribution piping system, onto which fire sprinklers are connected. Although historically only used in factories and large commercial buildings, home and small building systems are now available at a cost-effective price. Sprinkler activation will do less damage than a fire department hose stream, which provides approximately 900 liters/min. A typical sprinkler used for industrial manufacturing occupancies discharge about 75-150 liters/min (20-40 US gallons/min). However, a typical Early Suppression Fast Response (ESFR) sprinkler at a pressure of 50 psi will discharge approximately 100 US gallons per minute (0.0063 m3/s). In addition, a sprinkler will usually activate between one and four minutes, whereas the fire department typically takes at least five minutes to arrive at the fire site after receiving an alarm, and an additional ten minutes to set up equipment and apply hose streams to the fire. This additional time can result in a much larger fire, requiring much more water to extinguish.
